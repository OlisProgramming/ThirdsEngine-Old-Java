# ThirdsEngine
ThirdsEngine is a game engine based off a minimal LibGDX framework.
It enables programmers to code 3D games without having to worry about low-level code or hassles with build tools, etc.

Git Flow is used, so you can find all stable commits on the `master` branch, all experimental code on the `develop` branch and all unfinished code or partially completed code on branches with the prefix `feature/`.

# Usage
Just download the latest release (the most recent commit to the `master` branch) and get programming! Point the `com.thirds.game.GameDetails` class to your game class
and begin. Check out the Wiki for more detailed tutorials on usage.
